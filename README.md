# "RostovExpress" Delivery Service #

# LINK: https://mzhernevskii.pythonanywhere.com #

# Idea #
The service allows users to register in the system and take on various roles: regular user, courier, admin.

Each role has its own possibilities:
1. The user can order delivery.
2. The courier delivers, receives money, and earns a rating.
3. The admin has the right to hire and dismiss couriers, promote other users to the admin status.

Also, the service represents a REST API. The API gives the user both admin and courier rights simultaneously.

The main admin is always present in the database, allowing the appointment of couriers and admins.
